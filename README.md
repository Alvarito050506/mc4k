Minecraft 4K, but fixed.

## Controls
 + Movement: `"WASD"`
 + Next block: Left arrow
 + Previous block: Right arrow
 + Save world: `'G'`
 + Load world: `'C'`

## Credits and licensing
I don't even know from where the original code comes, but I downloaded it from a [post](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1290821-minecraft-4k-improved-by-crunchycat-download-now?comment=60) in the MCForums. It looks like it was a modified version of the original reverse-engineered Minecraft 4K code.

All my modifications were made for the only purpose of making it more playable, feel free to modify and distribute them.
